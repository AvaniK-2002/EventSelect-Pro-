<br>
Payment in full is due no later than 7 days prior to the event date. This may be made via electronic transfer, debit card, cheque or credit card (3% fee - 4% on AMEX). The company reserves the right to cancel the event if payment has not been received in full.<br>
<br>

<li><b>Inclusions</b></li>
<br>
The company will supply all activity equipment and instructors, venue costs as detailed in the invoice (if applicable), event management and public liability insurance of £5,000,000.
<br>
<br>
<li><b>Substitution</b></li>
<br>
The company reserves the right to substitute a comparable activity for another in the event of equipment failure or circumstances beyond its reasonable control.
<br>
<br>
<li><b>Drugs and Alcohol</b></li>
<br>
The company may refuse participation to guests who are believed to be under the influence of drugs or alcohol. No refund will be made in such circumstances.
<br>
<br>
<li><b>Company Authority</b></li>
<br>
The customer recognises the authority of the company’xs Event manager and Skippers, understanding that they may take any decision they regard as necessary to ensure the health, welfare and safety of those taking part in the event.
<br>
<br>
<li><b>Changing Dates</b></li>
<br>
Every effort will be made to change the event date when requested, although the company reserves the right to charge 10% of the event value. The charge may be higher when it has not been possible to cancel subcontractors or venues. No change may be made within 30 days of the event.
<br>
<br>
<li><b>Cancellation</b></li>
<br>
Whether or not payment has been made, if the customer cancels within 4 weeks of the event there is a 100% cancellation fee. Cancellation between 4 weeks and 8 weeks from the event incurs a 50% cancellation fee. Cancellation more than 8 weeks from the event incurs a 15% cancellation fee.
<br>
<br>
<li><b>Change in number of attendees</b></li>
<br>
A reduction in the number of attendees does not usually result in a refund and never within 30 days of the event. If numbers are reduced more than 30 days before the event, then every effort will be made to save variable costs such as catering etc. 
<br>
<br>

<li><b>Force Majeure</b></li>
<br>
The company may postpone the event where forces outside of the company’s control such as bad weather, acts of terrorism or other events which cannot be reasonably mitigated against, impact the running of the event. No liability for any costs or expenses incurred by the customer are accepted by the company in the event of cancellation or postponement.
<br>
<br>
<li><b>Weather</b></li>
<br>
When rain is forecast, the company will use extra marquees, move activities indoors where possible and issue complimentary 'rapmacs'.  The event will take place unless it is deemed unsafe to do so by the Event Manager, and if this is the case, an alternative date will be arranged.
<br>
<br>
<li><b>Inflatable Events</b></li>
<br>
It is unsafe to operate ‘Inflatable’ events in the rain. The company will use a Met Office forecast 48 hours prior to the event to determine whether the event should proceed. If continuous rain is forecast, then the customer will be offered the opportunity to postpone to a mutually convenient date or a refund. The company accepts no liability for consequential losses incurred by the customer such as hotels and flights in the event of postponement or cancellation.
<br>
